            <h2>The Communist Manifesto</h2>
            <p> Published in 1848, this seminal work outlines the basic principles of communism, including the class 
                struggle between the proletariat (working class) and the bourgeoisie (capitalist class). It argues that
                the ultimate goal of communism is the establishment of a classless society in which private property is 
                abolished and the means of production are owned collectively.<br><br>

                The novel paints a bleak picture of a world in which individuality and free thought are suppressed,
                history is rewritten to serve the interests of the ruling Party, and citizens are kept under constant
                surveillance. The Party uses a sophisticated system of propaganda and thought control, embodied in the
                slogan "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength."<br><br>

                Winston Smith's rebellion is ultimately crushed, and he is subjected to intense torture and brainwashing
                in the notorious Room 101. The novel ends with him having fully embraced the Party's ideology and loving
                Big Brother.<br><br>
                "The Waste Land" is a complex and influential poem that reflects on the disillusionment and despair of the post-World War I era. The poem is known for its fragmented structure, allusions to mythology and literature, and themes of death and rebirth.
                "1984" is widely regarded as a classic of dystopian fiction and a warning against the dangers of
                totalitarianism and the abuse of power. Its themes of government surveillance, propaganda, and the
                manipulation of language and truth remain highly relevant in contemporary political discourse. The novel
                has had a significant cultural impact, and the term "Orwellian" has become a shorthand for a dystopian
                society characterized by oppressive government control.</p>
