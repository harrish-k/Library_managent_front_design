            <h2>Arundhati Roy </h2>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy" target="_blank"><img id="author-img" src="../images/arundathi_roy.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <p> Arundhati Roy is a renowned Indian author, activist, and public intellectual. She is best known for her
                critically acclaimed novel "The God of Small Things," which won the Booker Prize in 1997. In addition to
                her literary achievements, Arundhati Roy is also a vocal critic of Indian politics and has been actively
                involved in social and environmental activism.
                <br><br>
                "The God of Small Things" is a novel that explores the themes of love, loss, and social discrimination
                in contemporary India. The story is set in Kerala and revolves around the lives of two fraternal twins,
                Rahel and Estha. The novel has been praised for its lyrical prose and vivid portrayal of the cultural
                and political landscape of India.
                <br> <br>
                In addition to "The God of Small Things," Arundhati Roy has written several non-fiction books that offer
                a scathing critique of Indian politics and society. Some of her notable works include "The Algebra of
                Infinite Justice," "Broken Republic," and "Capitalism: A Ghost Story."

                "The Algebra of Infinite Justice" is a collection of essays that offer a critique of Indian politics,
                the war on terror, and globalization. The book was well-received by critics and readers and established
                Arundhati Roy as a prominent voice in Indian intellectual discourse.
                <br><br>
                "Broken Republic" is a collection of three essays that examine the impact of corporate capitalism and
                state violence on India's marginalized communities. The book offers a powerful critique of India's
                development model and highlights the urgent need for social and environmental justice.
                <br><br>
                "Capitalism: A Ghost Story" is a book that explores the impact of neoliberalism on India's democracy and
                cultural identity. The book offers a damning critique of the Indian elite and their complicity in the
                exploitation of the poor.

                Overall, Arundhati Roy's works have been widely praised for their literary merit and social commentary.
                Her writings have sparked important conversations about India's political and social landscape and have
                inspired many to fight for justice and equality. In recognition of her contributions to literature and
                activism, Arundhati Roy was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in 2004.
